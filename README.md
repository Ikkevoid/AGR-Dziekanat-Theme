# APR Dziekanat Theme
 Theme for APR ProAkademia Dziekanat, fixing styling mistakes and design hell, small project that tries to protect my eyes from horrendous user interface that sometimes I have to use. Started really easy with initial styles, but went wrong when some styles broke things cause all the modules are really inconsistent with their classes and even elements.
